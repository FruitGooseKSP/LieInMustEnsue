# Lie In Must Ensue (L.I.M.E)
DESCRIPTION

On Kerbal Space Program, I personally don't enjoy launching rockets or planes etc in the dark so am an avid user of "Warp To Next Morning". Unfortunately, the game defines "Next Morning" as dawn, which is still too dark for my liking. 

This mini-mod very simply changes the time that "Morning" is defined as (it sets it an hour later than stock) so now it is bright and sunny when it finishes warping.

Go on, have yourself a lie in.


NOTES

- This addon is called once when you arrive at the space center. There is no on/off button so if installed, it will be active.


INSTALLATION NOTES

Install into your KSP/GameData folder as normal. This mod is part of the "FruitKocktail" suite of mini-mods so will usually reside inside that folder.
